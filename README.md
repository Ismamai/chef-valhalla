Valhalla is an open source routing engine and accompanying libraries for use with Open Street Map and other open data sets. The chef-valhalla repository, as its name suggests, is a chef cookbook. The cookbook demonstrates how to deploy the valhalla stack to a virtual machine (sample vagrant file included). Upon completion the virtual machine will have cut a set of routable graph tiles and started up a server to handle route requests against that tile set. We hope this can serve as a primer on how one might deploy valhalla in one's own routing cluster.

Deployment Types
----------------

Vagrant allows you to run a virtual machine as if it were a node in cluster of machines, perhaps in the cloud. We allow you to exercise several types of deployment simply by making use of different combinations of recipies within the cookbook. Currently we have the following deployment types: Global Tile Cutter, Routing Service (route/matrix/locate requests), Elevation Service (height requests), Extract Routing Service (like routing above but on static OSM extract).

TODO: describe all of the recipes and the combinations needed to make the deployment types above, this info is laying around in a google doc some
